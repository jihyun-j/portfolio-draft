        <p>Checkco is an app that can check the ingredients of personal care and cosmetic products for those who want to avoid harmful components and chemicals so that users can find the right cosmetics for their skin and protect their skin health.

        <p class="research-content">I interviewed and surveyed 10 participants (7 survey + 3 user interview) who use daily care and cosmetic products. The ages are different between the 20s and 30s, mostly women.
            Review & Price are top priorities when people purchase cosmetic products.
            Sometimes reviews are not helpful since people have different skin types and concerns.
            Ingredients are not their consideration, but people have curious about whether it is harmful or not.</p>

            <h3>Usability and accessibility are essential, but credibility is crucial:</h3> 
                <p>This project is related to health, so credible organizations should verify the information so that users can trust the information and purchase the products.</p> 
            <h3>Iteration, Iteration, and Iteration:</h3>
                <p>I had some new ambiguities and assumptions during the project, but it was helpful to back to the research phase and verify the hypotheses. </p>
            <h3>Listen to users: </h3> 
                <p>I would like to hear from more users and test if I have a chance since users are the key to developing the products.</p>
