        <p class="title">Overview</p>
        <p>Checkco is an app that can check the ingredients of personal care and cosmetic products for those who want to avoid harmful components and chemicals so that users can find the right cosmetics for their skin and protect their skin health. It is the passion project that I conducted the whole process of conducting user interviews and wireframes.</p>

    <section class="narrow-width">
        <p class="title">Problem</p>
        <p>The companies listed all ingredients, about 10 -20 on the package box, but most people don't know the ingredient's effection since they have to spend much time to search each component.
            People were disappointed after using the products even though they read through many reviews and compared other products.</p>

        <p>Initial Assumptions: </p>
        <li>How uers purchase cosmetic products?</li>
        <li>What are the mort important factors when they purchase cosmetic products?</li>
        <li>Do they care about ingredients?</li>

        <p>I interviewed and surveyed 10 participants (7 survey + 3 user interview) who use daily care and cosmetic products. The ages are different between the 20s and 30s, mostly women.
            Review & Price are top priorities when people purchase cosmetic products.
            Sometimes reviews are not helpful since people have different skin types and concerns.
            Ingredients are not their consideration, but people have curious about whether it is harmful or not.</p>
