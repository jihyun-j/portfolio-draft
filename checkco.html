        <p>Checkco is an app that can check the ingredients of personal care and cosmetic products for those who want to avoid harmful components and chemicals so that users can find the right cosmetics for their skin and protect their skin health.

            <p>1. The companies listed all ingredients, about 10 -20 on the package box, but most people don't know the ingredient's effection since they have to spend much time to search each component. </p>
            <p>2. People were disappointed after using the products even though they read through many reviews and compared other products.</p>

            <p>Find the right cosmetic products for their skin type and concern.</p>
            <p>Educate themselves to avoid chemical and harmful ingredients.</p>

    <h3>Research</h3>
    <p>I interviewed and surveyed 10 participants who use daily care and cosmetic products. The ages are different between the 20s and 30s, mostly women.
        Review & Price are top priorities when people purchase cosmetic products.
        Sometimes reviews are not helpful since people have different skin types and concerns.
        Ingredients are not their consideration, but people have curious about whether it is harmful or not.</p>

    <h3>Sign-up page</h3>
        <p>When users sign up for the app, the app will collect their personal and skin health information so that the app can provide the recommended cosmetic/skincare products on the home screen.</p>
    
    <h3>Home</h3>
        <p>It gives recommendation products so that users can explore quickly without spending time searching. </p>
        <p>Review is the most critical consumers consideration, so I decided to add the most reviews/popular products on the home page.</p>
        <p>I added an informative section to keep users engaged.</p>

    <h3>Search</h3>
        <p>Before searching for products or ingredients, users can discover the products when users don't have specific products to find.</p>
        <p>Users can scan the products to check safety. Also, they can search products to check and compare safety, Price, and reviews for a final decision.</p>
    
    <h3>Product</h3>
        <p>It provides essential information about users' leading priorities, such as reviews and prices when purchasing beauty products.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>It shows the summary of products safety to recognize whether the product safe or not quickly.</p>

    <section class="reflection">
        <h2 class="title">Reflection</h2>
            <h3>Usability and accessibility are essential, but credibility is crucial:</h3> 
                <p>This project is related to health, so credible organizations should verify the information so that users can trust the information and purchase the products.</p> 
            <h3>Iteration, Iteration, and Iteration:</h3>
                <p>I had some new ambiguities and assumptions during the project, but it was helpful to back to the research phase and verify the hypotheses. </p>
            <h3>Listen to users: </h3> 
                <p>I would like to hear from more users and test if I have a chance since users are the key to developing the products.</p>
