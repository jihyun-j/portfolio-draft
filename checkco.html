            <p class="title">Overview</p>
            <p>This project is my passion for understanding the UX design process and fundamentals. The app idea came across the documentary 'Toxic Beauty' that shows cosmetic and personal care products affect the unhealthy way to the human body. So, I designed the Checkco app that can check the ingredients of personal care and cosmetic products for those who want to avoid harmful components and chemicals so that users can find the right cosmetics for their skin and protect their health.

            It is the users' daily routine during the interview. People use cosmetics and skin care products to protect their skin for beauty. However, people are unfamiliar with its ingredients, and they rarely check with it even though it could affect the unhealthy way in their body. Besides, the ingredients' name is chemical jargon, so it is hard to understand without explanation unless people are experts. </p>

            <p>To start off, I used both qualitative and quantitative research methods. I created a survey form to prove my initial assumption. Then, I conducted in-depth user interviews with three target audiences to uncover their pain points and needs. I created affinity mapping for the group and organized the information.
