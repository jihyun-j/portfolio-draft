            <h2 class="title">Overview</h2>
            <p>I had an opportunity that works as a UX design apprentice at BRIDGEGOOD. BRIDGEGOOD is a non-profit organization that supports design students develop their skills and industry knowledge. My teammates and I were assigned a design sprint to create the internship/entry-level job opportunities feature to provide inclusive and accessible job opportunities for entry-level design students.
                During work with my tames, I had a chance to do the user interview, wireframe, and prototype.

            <h2 class="title">Problems</h2>
            <p>Job hunting is not easy for students since they lack experience. However, most companies prefer applicants with more than two years of experience, and they post many requirements on the job posting. It makes students overwhelmed and hesitant to apply. Students from the BRIDGEGOOD UX Design Apprenticeship have limited-to-no industry experience and want to gain real-world experience by getting hired for an internship.</p>

        <p>It is my first case study to conceptualize UX fundamentals. Before learning the fundamentals, It was hard to specify and define the problems. But, when I went through the design process helped me to narrow down the problem and direction to find a better solution.
